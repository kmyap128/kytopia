    <h2>Goal of my site</h2>
    <p>This site is meant to eventually be my personal portfolio where I can display my projects, whether they be coding projects, artwork, or videos. The audience would be perspective employers. Because of this, I chose a design that fits my personality and aesthetic so it could best represent me and my work.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Throughout this project I got to play around with a lot of design features and I learned a lot. For example, getting my images to display text over them when hovered over, and making an overlay over a picture banner. I put a lot of thought and effort into trying to get my cool features to work. One of the biggest challenges I faced was getting my grid to work corrently. I was constantly having problems with there being odd gaps between my sections as the page got narrower. However, that may stem from the fact that I made a mistake of starting at a wide screen before moving on to fixing the display for narrower screens. This made it hard to adjust elements without changing a lot of my code. Overall, I am happy with the amount that I learned and was able to implement, but I want to improve the responsiveness more in the future as the mobile version did not turn out how I hoped it would.</p>
