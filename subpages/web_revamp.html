            Arrowhead Intranet Redesign
        </h2>

        <div id="content">
            <p>Over the course of a 10 week internship at Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, I had the opportunity to work closely with the People Services and Information Technology teams. My primary task was to redesign pages on the company intranet to make them more effient, user friendly, and visually consistent.</p>

            <p>The process consisted of creating mockups and drafts in Figma (or directly in SharePoint once a consistent design style was established), presenting it to the department, collecting feedback, and making changes as necessary. Throughout the internship, I gained valuable experience in working with SharePoint and ShortPoint, incorporating differing feedback into my work, and learning what users generally expect when they visit a web page.</p>

            <p>
                Below are samples of my work, including the original pages(not designed by me) and the final designs I proposed at the end of my internship. For the sake of company and employee privacy, some information and images have been blurred.
